# Cats Vs. Cucumbers (for:WebGL / Browser)
Cats Vs Cucumbers is a Game inspired by seeing my son watch youtube videos of the same name.  For the source-code, It was made in Unity-3D, with C# back end scripting.  At the time (Feb 2015) I was working through Unity-3D Space-Shooter Tutorial.  
 https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial

Once I completed the main task of the tutorial I deployed to my android device, Then of-course learning the Unity-3D api to get touch screen input and tilt input.  

I asked my son If we should change the asteroids to cats and the lasers to cucumbers.  He said yes and asked me to complete it.  At some point early on, (this version) I wanted to try Deploying to WebGL also, and so that is what you get here.

Enjoy,
Toby

## Installation

No install is required, this is a web browser ready build, that works for keyboard input.

```bash
just click index.html, and wait a few seconds, one error message pops up, but game works
```

## Usage

```python
keyboard arrow move ship
keyboard Ctrl key fires, and contines at game-over
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome for that error message only please. This is just a goof, representative of an early version of the game with way more features avialable in my Andorid version.
